# This python script will fetch the latest data on scryfall,
# a MTG card database with a suitable API to update the various
# files in the data/ directory.
#
# Those files are then used by the rust build script to generate the required enums for the game.
# Please note that not all files are automatically fetched and generated, so it is not
# recommanded to remove all the data/ folder and rerun the script.
# Instead, simply run this python script and it will override the outdated files.
#
# This script shall be run every once in a while (with every new extension)
# to keep up with the new sets.
